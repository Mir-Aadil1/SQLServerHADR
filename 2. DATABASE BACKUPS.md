DATABASE BACKUP : Out of Sight , Out of Mind 

- a copy of SQL Server data that can be used to restore and recover the data after a failure
- allows for restore 
- allows for possbile ROLLBACK ( oops error)
- eg. drop table, update without where clause
- helps manage the size of transaction logs (when running log backups)


Types : 

FULL : 
- contains ALL THE DATA in a specific database or set of filegroups or files, and also  ENOUGH LOG  to allow for recovering that data.

- The STARTING POINT of all other types of backups 

- the POINT-IN-TIME that you get with your backup is when the DATA-READING PORTION of the backup process COMPLETES 


![the timeline](<LectureImages/timeline.png>)  

DIFFERENTIAL : (CUMULATIVE)

- based on the latest full backup of a complete or partial database or a set of data files or filegroups and that contains only the data extents that have changed since the differential base

Log backups : (INCREMENTAL)


-  includes all log records that were not backed up in a previous log backup. (in-sequence)


==================

- As your database becomes LARGER , you start to introduce other types of backups 

FILE or FILEGROUP 

- a backup of ONE or MORE DATABASE FILES OR FILEGROUPS (This is more about changing backup strategy)

- Rearchitecting database 

PARTIAL FILEGROUP : 

- contains data from only some of the filegroups in a database, including the data in the primary filegroup, every read/write filegroup, and any optionally-specfied read-only files 

COPY-ONLY 

a special-use backup that is INDEPENDENT of the REGULAR SEQUENCE Of SQL Server backups 
- if you don't want to break the log sequence chain 


- > How do you choose your policy 


   - refer to your RPO/RTO/SLA
   - keep it SIMPLE **
   - create a restore strategy based on RPO/RTO/SLA 
   - regularly test backups (this is the only way to test if backups are working)
   - Configure BACKUP CHECKSUM (on entire instance)
        .Specifies that the backup operation verifies each page for checksum and torn page, if enabled and available, and generate a checkusm for the entire backup
