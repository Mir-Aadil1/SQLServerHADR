Database Recovery Models :  

- are designed to control transaction log maintenance 
- Implementation of RPO at the database level 
- If somebody says I don't care about RPO, that gives me idea what recovery model should be. 
- SQL Server backup and restore operations occur within the context of the database recovery model 


SIMPLE : actually reclaims transaction log <space> to keep space requirements small ( NO log backup)

- unless auto shrink Job , no size reclaimation , ( Don't do it )

- Hence no log backup , NO point-in-time recoverability 

- If you are doing one backup a day, this means you are ok wiht loosing 24hrs of data 

- Start by defining RPO 

FULL : < ALL CHANGES > in the database are kept in the transaction logs

- Both user and system transactions 

- allows for point-in-time recoverability 

- no work is lost due to a lost or damaged data file 

- Requires tlog backups 


Bulk-Logged : Minimal tlog space is used by bulk operations 

- permists high-performacne bulk copy operation 

- allows for point-in-time recoverability 

Pseudo-simple : 

Pseudo-simple means that a database in the full recovery model will behave as though it is in the simple recovery model until the first full backup is taken (the last Log Sequence Number that was backed up is recorded).

database in FULL RECOVERY MODEL behaves like it's in SIMPLE RECOVERY MODEL 

- The model database defaults to FULL 
- FIrst full is must and then db actually switches to FULL
